## Overview

Python  combines remarkable  power  with  very clear  syntax.  It has  modules,
classes,  exceptions,  very   high  level  dynamic  data   types,  and  dynamic
typing. There are interfaces to many system  calls and libraries, as well as to
various windowing systems.  New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++
(or other  languages, depending on  the chosen implementation). Python  is also
usable as  an extension  language for applications  written in  other languages
that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.
